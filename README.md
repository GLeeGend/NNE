- I recommend you to use Anaconda and jupyter notebook for python and Ipython(ver 3.6). You can download in (https://www.anaconda.com/download/). For Windows users, you can execute jupyter notebook through cmd, inputting a command 'jupyter notebook'. Adding anaconda to the system PATH environment variable is recommended for convenience when you are installing.
