## Assignment information

- There is step by step explanation in NNE_assignment1_softmax.ipynb file. Just follow and enjoy it.
- We recommend you to write *generally appliable* code. 
  - ex) Use dimension = X_tr.shape[1] instead of dimension = 3073. Because if you use dim=3073 and the input shape is changed, your code does not work.
- Please do not change any function name, function inputs, and function outputs.
- Please write your code only in square box like below.
